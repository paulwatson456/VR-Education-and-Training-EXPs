Once module is installed you can rebuild the engine without errors and use the project.

Project requires significant assets due to the varied aethetics of the vrtual rooms. These can be found in file "MemSeg_EXP_03_UE_Assets".

Log cabin level is missing a couple of assets for the background and will need to be rebuilt (door and window) and added to the level again.
